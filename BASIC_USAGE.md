# Startup Guide

The goal of qiskit is to provide a python backend interface for programming to use the QASM (the assembly language for the IBMQ devices) which you can write directly/transpile to manually later.
To run a quantum experiment you have 5 basic steps. 

1. INITIALIZE (circuits and states)
2. DRAW (the circuit)
3. CONNECT TO THE BACKEND and RUN
4. STORE and RETRIEVE RESULTS
5. PLOT THE RESULTS
