This is meant to create a comprehensive notes for the Qiskit Summer School for reference during and after the school.

## What to do ?
This will contain notebooks (**NO SOLUTIONS**) of code on a day-by-day basis . Only to serve a reference for things taught during the lectures and labs to help others in future.
Also it will serve as comprehensive set of Summer School Notes. You will also learn how to collaborate on organisation projects on github (for newcomers who haven't used version-control before)
- Everyone can contribute to the notebooks by doing pull-requests, after your contributions.
- Put up **ISSUES** for corrections/and mistakes
